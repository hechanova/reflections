1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When I'm working on multiple computers, working with others remotely, or 
possibly, when I'm worried about local storage reliability.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows you to review changes that have been made to
the repository and lowers the risk of conflict.
