1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When I'm working on multiple computers, working with others remotely, or 
possibly, when I'm worried about local storage reliability.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows you to review changes that have been made to
the repository and lowers the risk of conflict.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

I'd use a fork to work on someone else's repository via GitHub when I don't
have permission (or want) to make changes directly to their repository. I'd 
clone a repository if I want to make changes to a shared repository. A branch
is a bifurcated version of a repository.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

Storing the last known state of the remote locally allows quick access to edit
and review previous commits, and you can build off of the most up-to-date 
version of files as possible.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or GitHub, I might store files on Dropbox or maybe I'd try a
different version control system like SVN. I'm sure SVN has certain benefits
and drawbacks I'm not currently aware of since most popular systems have trade-
offs. Dropbox would bypass needing to use commands to update things, but my
collaborators and I would lose control over when our files are updated.
