1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When I'm working on multiple computers, working with others remotely, or 
possibly, when I'm worried about local storage reliability.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually allows you to review changes that have been made to
the repository and lowers the risk of conflict.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

I'd use a fork to work on someone else's repository via GitHub when I don't
have permission (or want) to make changes directly to their repository. I'd 
clone a repository if I want to make changes to a shared repository. A branch
is a bifurcated version of a repository.
