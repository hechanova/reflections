1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a new repository. I need to create a new
repository in order to start a brand new project.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary workspace where I can add, edit and review
files. It's valuable to have an interim space where I can test things and
either commit them or reset.
